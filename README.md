## Motivation ##

We plan to create Value Liquid as a major pillar to the Value ecosystem. At the current yield farming state, liquidity providing is a game of incentive. Farmers don’t discriminate, they just chase the best possible yields. That comes with a big disadvantage for all participants of the network : crazy high gas fee. That leaves all small farmers who can’t afford the costs out of the game.

Committing to our mission, we create Value Liquid as an one-stop solution for all farmers. By joining Value Liquid, you are guaranteed to enjoy highest yield farming profit and lowest cost, we’ll take care of everything else for you.
